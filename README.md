# E09a-First-Person-Character

This is a player character creation exercise serving as our intro to 3D assets in GODOT for the class MSCH-G 220 Game Technology.

Though a simple exercise, within this you should have a visable shotgun model within your viewport, as well as be able to rotate your camera up, down, left, and right. The player may also move in all directions, albeit with minimal space due to the exercise only being to create a functioning player mesh, not create a map.
